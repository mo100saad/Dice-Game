# Dice-Game
 The Dice Game is a solo betting game starting with 500 points. Players bet, roll two dice, and gain or lose points based on the roll: double fours win big, while sums of 7 or 11 add bonuses. Other outcomes cost points. The goal is to reach 1,000 points to win or avoid dropping to zero to prevent losing.
